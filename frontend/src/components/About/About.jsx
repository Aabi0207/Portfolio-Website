      Hi, I'm Abhishek Biradar, a Bachelor of Engineering student in Information Technology with a passion for building impactful tech solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="about-description">My journey in coding began three years ago with foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Driven by a keen interest in data science and machine learning, I soon chose Python as my primary language. Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with powerful backend frameworks like Flask and Django, enabling me to develop dynamic, data-driven applications.</p>
